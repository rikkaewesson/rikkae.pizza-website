I'm David. I like computers, and non-computer things. I have a wife and three kitties. I'm happiest late at night in a linux command line session on a distant server, or in my home lab here in the DC area. At work, I want to focus on connecting with people on a personal level and solving hard technical problems. 

At work, you'll see me in terminal, drawing on a whiteboard, or making an updog joke in slack. 

Reach out - Let's solve something together.
